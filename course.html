primeface

***define them in web.xml as contex

****primeface has ajax nby default : to disable => ajax attribute
ajax = "false"

to implement SPA => GWT

BEST PRACTICE: use of value instead of binding component


AUTHENTICATION------ge adn
=> web.xml
=> tomee.xml : resources
=> server.xml : realm

 similar to basic authentication => it needs https

 ------------
 EJB object pooling
 interface => @Local annotation
 interface => @Remote annotation
 two interfaces

SESSION 3

JNDI--->similar to RMI
EJB uses JNDI
CORBA RMI

online execution => REST SOAP RMI JNDI,... all of them
Message Broker => offline

all of them are based-on socket

*use case => online shopping => gateway =>transactions must be online

Message Containers => guarantees messages

Weblogic and Jboss => best for Clustering

ResultSet cant be serializable
ResultSet to ArrayList

AutoClosable....

business role @RolesAllowed => error code 500
Tow different datasource in application server
JTA => @PersistenceContext
1-non transactional
2-transactional

define in persistent.xlm
and then define datasources in tomee

*Best practice => JTA

SESSION 4

Batis

JPA is not implemented in Batis

When to use Batis??? =>> Stored procedures

Batis can turn off cache layer => communicating without cache
Batis is a generic data access

like old hibername we have two files :
batis.xml => reference to person.xml
preson.xml => definition for person functions
tag's bodies are just like BD Console

NO-SQL
unstructured data will be caused to No-SQL
MongoDB is most popular and worst case

OWASP

SESSION 5

BPMS

Process... including human tasks and machine tasks (such as communicating with
WebService...)
A process is not limited to only one service!

* nearly all system analysises are Process-based

form designer in process-based system is just a tool

Tow branches to design processes:

PDL-Process Definition Languange
BPMN-Business Process Model and Notation

* Difference between PDL and BPMN is on notation
* A process is not identified by developer or analyzer

data-oriented analysis
process-oriented analysis
behavior-oriented analysis

******** PDL

* fasad apex veka

Process engine => 1- Execution Servuce (ES) 2- Repository Service (RS)
JDPL will be deployed on RS
users uses ES

with ES we can start processes

most important table is HIST....

BPMS is integrated with hibernate

JBPM 4.0 best performance - v 6.0 is highweight
